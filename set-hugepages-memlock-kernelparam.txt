Dear Basel,

We will follow the below procuder:

1-	Upgrade DB memory to 32GB instead of 18GB on the second node then the first node.
2-	Start the DB
3-	Calculate the new huge pages size (lets say the new huge page size is equal x)
4-	Set the new huge pages kernel parameter usning .sh script
5-	Set memlock kernel parameter as the following equation (output * page size):

(HugePages * Hugepagesize) for example based on the current setting: memory lock should be: 36886* 2048= 75542528

This value subject to change after upgrading the memory.
The value must be set into the two nodes with same steps
