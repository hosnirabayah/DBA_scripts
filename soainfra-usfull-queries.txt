Query to find the count of the instances of particular Composites created on particular time   
SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(COMPOSITE_NAME) COUNT,COMPOSITE_NAME FROM CUBE_INSTANCE WHERE CREATION_DATE BETWEEN TO_DATE('09/20/2016 00:00:00','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS') AND TO_DATE('09/20/2016 23:00:00','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS')  AND COMPOSITE_NAME IN (‘<<CompositeName1>>’, ‘<<CompositeName2>>’) GROUP BY COMPOSITE_NAME ) ORDER BY COUNT DESC

Above query will give the count of both success and failed instances. In order to filter successful vs failed, add STATE clause as follows.
SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(COMPOSITE_NAME) COUNT,COMPOSITE_NAME FROM CUBE_INSTANCE WHERE CREATION_DATE BETWEEN TO_DATE('09/20/2016 00:00:00','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS') AND TO_DATE('09/20/2016 23:00:00','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS') AND COMPOSITE_NAME IN (‘<<CompositeName1>>’, ‘<<CompositeName2>>’) AND STATE=5 GROUP BY COMPOSITE_NAME ) ORDER BY COUNT DESC

State = 5 is successful instance
